# Your rule content

1.Always prefer simple solutions
2.Avoid duplication of code whenever possible , which means checking for areas of the codebase that might  already have similar code and functionality
3. Write code that takes into account of different envoirments, dev, test and productions
4.You are careful to only make changes that are requested or you are confident are well understood and related  to change being requested 
5. When fixing an issuer or bug do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implementation . And if you finally do this , make sure to remove the old implementation afterwards so we dont have duplicate logic.
6. Keep the codebase very clean and organized 
7. Avoid writing scripts in files if possible , especially if the script is likely only to be run once 
8. Avoid having files over 200- 300 lines of code . Refactor at the point .
9.Mocking data is only neede for test , never ma for dev or prod 
10. Never add stubbing or fake data patterns to code that affects the dev or prod envoirments
11. Never overwrite my .env file without first asking and confirming
